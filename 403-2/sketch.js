CaseNum: 403-2

Case 403 - Cornered - stage 3

We have Shiffman cornered at Algol fish whole-salers and more help is on the way.
Until our backup arrives the orders are to make sure he stays inside Algol fish whole-salers

Your job is to indicate that Shiffman (signified by the mouse) is indeed within the North - East - South - West bounds of Algol fish whole-salers.
Draw a BlueViolet rectangle covering Algol fish whole-salers for as long as Shiffman is in it.

Use X11 colours. You can find a reference table at https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-iccprof#numerical.

There are many possible ways of investigating this case, but you should use ONLY the following commands, operators and variables:

  if(){}
  >
  <
  &&
  fill()  - Use r,g,b values between 0 and 255.
  rect()
  mouseX
  mouseY

*/

var img;

function preload()
{
	img = loadImage('map.jpg');
}

function setup()
{
	createCanvas(img.width,img.height);
}

function draw()
{
    // draw the image
    image(img,0,0);

    //Write your code below here ...
    if(mouseX > 1460 && mouseX < 1565 && mouseY > 615 && mouseY < 695)
    {
      fill(138,43,226)
      rect(1462,615, 104, 79)
    }

    // finally, draw Shiffman's position
    strokeWeight(2);
    stroke(255);
    fill(255,0,0);
    ellipse(mouseX, mouseY, 10, 10);

    // a helpful mouse coordinate pointer
    fill(255);
    noStroke();
    text(`${mouseX},${mouseY}`,mouseX, mouseY);
}
