Each task involves solving a crime using p5.js and overall JavaScript.
At the beginning, we receive a base of the project and our task is to modify it in such a way that it meets the expectations of the solution.  
The solution is then uploaded and we receive a grade.  
Each case is broken down into several smaller parts.
